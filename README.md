# Matrix-Game

This matlab program demonstrates a basic mixed-strategy game theory of Matrix game.

It outputs four strategies: `pMefirst`,`qMefirst`,`pYoufirst`,`qYoufirst` and 
computes respective expected value of the game: `E(pMefirst, qMefirst)`, `E(pYoufirst, qYoufirst)`, `E(pMefirst, qYoufirst)`, `E(pYoufirst, qMefirst)`
